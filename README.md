# Matrix Multiplication in CUDA and OpenMP

An implementation of classical and Strassen's matrix multiplication in CUDA and OpenMP.



## Description

These codes are written for experimental results in my bachelor thesis, _Investigation and Experiments on Strassen's Algorithm_. You can see the paper in [here](paper.pdf).

See `README.md` in each subdirectory for the corresponding implementation.



## Requirements

- CUDA
- OpenMP
- GNU MP (for `OpenMP/mm-gmp.cpp`)
